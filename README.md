#data_scraper.py (built on Python 3.7.7 64 bit)
This is a Python data scraper for scraping metadata for all English data sets from Open Canada website (https://open.canada.ca/en/open-data). It allows users to download the metadata of the entire website or only for specific subjects. When complete, it saves a JSON file (open_data.json) on your Hard driver. You may input this JSON file into a local database or application, then build complex queries to find the datasets you need (download link of the files are included).

#Record_JSON_structure.txt
This the structure map of the JSON file.

#open_data.json
It is a JSON file example that I scraped under "Military" subject.
