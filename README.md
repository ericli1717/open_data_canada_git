#data_scraper.py (built on Python 3.7.7 64 bit)
This is a Python data scraper for scraping metadata for all English data sets from Open Canada website (https://open.canada.ca/en/open-data). Current update allow to input specific subject name on function find_subj_page() to download all metadata under this subject. It generates a JSON file (open_data.txt) on the same folder. You may input this JSON file into a database or application, then build a complex query to find the files you need.

This the structure map of the JSON file.
